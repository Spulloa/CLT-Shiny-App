# CLT-Shiny-App
DAT301 Central Limit Theory Calculator Shiny App

This shiny app is essentially a Central Limit Theorem Calculator, the app will receive input of sample size, sample mean, and sample standard deviation. Once “Graph Distribution” is clicked, a histogram will pop up of the distribution in reference to the inputs. Additionally, a checkbox allows you to show a dashed line where the mean falls on the graph. The graph will depict the population distribution of the mean to be approximately normal as the sample size increases which can be changed on the slider bar of the Shiny app. This depiction really defines the central limit theorem.
